# üéôÔ∏è Meeting Transcription and Entity Extraction App

This Streamlit web application allows users to upload an audio file (in WAV format) from a business meeting. The app automatically transcribes the audio into text using OpenAI's Whisper model and then extracts named entities (like persons, organizations, and locations) from the transcribed text using a BERT-based NER model.
